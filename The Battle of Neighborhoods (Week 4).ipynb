The features include median housing price and better school according to ratings, crime rates of that particular area, road connectivity, weather conditions, good management for emergency, water resources both freash and waste water and excrement conveyed in sewers and recreational facilities.\n\nIt will help people to get awareness of the area and neighborhood before moving to a new city, state, country or place for their work or to start a new fresh life."
